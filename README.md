# audio-equalizer üîâ

### Project Description :page_facing_up:

Development of an audio equalizer using MATLAB. One common Audio equalizer is the winamp program. The equalizer function is to vary the gain of each specific band as the user prefers. [ i.e., if the user likes base, he will increase the gain of low frequencies].
The given code allows the user to process a WAV file by applying various filters to different frequency ranges.

1. Reads the audio data and its properties (sampling rate and duration) & the output sample rate for the processed audio.
2. Allows the user to choose between two types of filters: Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) or Finite Impulse Response (FIR).
3. Filters the audio signal using the specified filters and amplifies each filtered signal based on the user-defined gains.
4. Generates a composite signal by summing up the amplified filtered signals.
5. Plots the filtered signals and the composite signal in the time and frequency domains.
6. Offers an option to analyze individual filters by providing information such as zeros, poles, gain, phase, order, impulse response, and step response.
7. Allows the user to choose to analyze multiple filters or exit the analysis.
